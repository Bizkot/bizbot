# Bizbot

Just messing with Discord.js.

## Installation

Add your own token in a token.json file at the project root :
```json
{
  "token": "MyToken"
}
```
Then you need node modules and there you go.

```bash
npm install
node index.js
```

You can use another prefix by modifying botconfig.json. Default is '!'.
